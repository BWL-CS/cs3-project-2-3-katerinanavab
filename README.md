# Python Template for CS3 

This repository provides a simple **template** with `Python` starter code. You can create your own copy by clicking `Use This Template` whenever you need to start a new Python program. For **unit notes**, **project instructions**, and **helpful resources**, refer to our course website: üìñ [PythonDocs](https://coderina.dev/pythondocs/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _DO NOT modify the following files:_ `.devcontainer`, `.vscode`

### üíª Codespaces Instructions
1. Click the green `<> Code` button in the top right area above the list of files
2. Select the `Codespaces` tab and click `Open new Codespace on main`
3. Wait for the Codespace to setup (_it will take some time because VSCode extensions are being installed_)
4. After the extensions load, you can open `main.py` from the **File Explorer** menu on the left, and now you're ready to code!
5. Always make sure to `commit changes` before closing a Codespace!
